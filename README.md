# Chasqui

⚠️ Chasqui is *very* early in development! Use with caution, e-mail me first. ⚠️

A [chasqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasqui) was a messenger of the Inca Empire. Agile, highly trained and physically fit, they were in charge of carrying messages in the form of [quipus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu) - lightweight strings with knots - to transmit lots of information at speed - up to 190 miles per day.

Chasqui (seeks to) generate static files that are small in size but deliver a feature-rich text viewing experience, optimal for loading on minimal hardware and/or minimal network availability.

## How?

Chasqui believes that we don't have to be luddites to keep things small.

Chasqui uses Vite and Rollup to create small, compiled Preact apps.

Chasqui compiles html from Markdown using Marked, and creates static html files that are small in size and pre-populated with content available to read before any JS runs.
